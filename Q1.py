        Solve Sudoku using backtracking algorithm.
        
        Algorithm:
        1. Find next empty cell (value = 0)
        2. Try values 1-9 in that cell
        3. For each value, check if it's valid (constraint checking = pruning)
        4. If valid, place it and recursively solve rest
        5. If no solution found, backtrack (undo placement)
        
        Pruning Strategy:
        - Before trying each value, we use is_valid() to prune invalid branches
        - This eliminates branches that violate row/column/box constraints
        - Without pruning, we'd try all 9^81 possibilities
        - With pruning, we eliminate most invalid paths early
        
        Time Complexity: O(9^m) where m is number of empty cells
        - Worst case: O(9^81) without pruning
        - Best case: O(m) with heavy constraint propagation
        - Average case: Much better due to early pruning
